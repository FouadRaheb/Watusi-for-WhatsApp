The all-in-one tweak for WhatsApp Messenger!

&nbsp;

## Download Links

* **Jailbreak:** You can either download it from BigBoss repo or add __[https://apt.fouadraheb.com](https://apt.fouadraheb.com)__ to your Cydia sources for the latest updated version. (Check [canijailbreak.com](https://canijailbreak.com/) for more info on how to jailbreak your current iOS version)
* **Sideloading (No Jailbreak):** 

    1. (Option 1) Download IPA file from here and follow the instructions below to sign and install the app from your computer for one week

    2. (Option 2) [Optional] You can get a paid subscription from a signing store where you can download the latest Watusi directly from your device and have it available for 1 year instead of 7 days. I recommend using [builds.io](https://builds.io/apps/WAtest/?aid=1025553) since they always have the latest IPA from here. Builds.io links: [Watusi](https://builds.io/apps/WAtest/?aid=1025553) - [Watusi Duplicate](https://builds.io/apps/duplicatewatusi/?aid=1025553).

## How to Sideload on non-jailbroken devices

### Requirements

1. A computer running macOS, Windows or Linux
2. Internet connection
3. Apple ID (email & password)

### Guide

* Download the IPA file from the link above and place it on your Desktop

* Download and run Cydia Impactor for your operating system from [here](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com)

* Make sure no other WhatsApp with the same bundle identifier is installed. (net.whatsapp.WhatsApp if you chose original IPA or com.fouadraheb.watusi for the duplicate)

* Connect your iOS device and hit "Trust" if prompted so that your device appears in Cydia Impactor

* Drag the IPA file from your Desktop to Cydia Impactor

* Wait for Cydia Impactor to finish and you will find the app installed on your device

### FAQ
* If you receive "Please sign in with app-specific password" error, that's beacuse you have 2-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID. You have to go into Apple's website https://appleid.apple.com, log in with your account and create an app-specific password to use as your Apple ID's password on Cydia Impactor.

### Note

* Signing with a non developer account will have the app expire in 7 days and you'll need to repeat the process again.
* The app will not receive Push Notifications and you won't be able to use iCloud features.
