to your Cydia sources for the latest updated version. (Check [canijailbreak.com](https://canijailbreak.com/) for more info on how to jailbreak your current iOS version)
* **Sideloading (No Jailbreak):** 

    1. (Option 1) Download IPA file from here and follow the instructions below to sign and install the app from your computer for one week

        | Application        | Version   | Watusi | Stalky |
        | ------------------ |:---------:|:------:|:------:|
        | [WhatsApp (__net.whatsapp.WhatsApp__)](https://mega.nz/file/lXhX1KYK#y9lMmQO2WGFuYRYmo89feR6piIj6x3_wX2IeWaIwoZY) | 2.20.51   | 1.2.40 | - |
        | [WhatsApp (__net.whatsapp.WhatsApp__)](https://mega.nz/file/ZOgBhS6Y#qqbVt3wdOkr8WnSqTv7HFraiaH0jGm2q583L60RLQfQ) | 2.20.51   | 1.2.40 | 4.1.3 |
        | [WhatsApp Duplicate (__com.fouadraheb.watusi__)](https://mega.nz/file/JO4DiCIa#vK6S18oPgxX3haXXgwswQFZQ1vO1UHPtiX3B4ByKgHU) | 2.20.51   | 1.2.40 | - |
        | [WhatsApp Duplicate (__com.fouadraheb.watusi__)](https://mega.nz/file/gSIxiAwT#1F-tuguBmrsWpX5R-clMKpYTQzExD1WUNk04PAn1fzM) | 2.20.51   | 1.2.40 | 4.1.3 |
        | [WhatsApp Business (__net.whatsapp.WhatsAppSMB__)](https://mega.nz/file/ZKw1AIDC#J4UBITLwywYay5tWTUVJWVcHMPv7s1kvDo3RJ-GBCX0) | 2.20.51   | 1.2.40 | - |
    
    2. (Option 2) [Optional] You can get a paid subscription from a signing store where you can download the latest Watusi directly from your device and have it available for 1 year instead of 7 days. I recommend using [builds.io](https://builds.io/apps/WAtest/?aid=1025553) since they always have the latest IPA from here. Builds.io links: [Watusi](https://builds.io/apps/WAtest/?aid=1025553) - [Watusi Duplicate](https://builds.io/apps/duplicatewatusi/?aid=1025553).

## How to Sideload on non-jailbroken devices

### Requirements

1. A computer running macOS, Windows or Linux
2. Internet connection
3. Apple ID (email & password)

### Guide

* Download the IPA file from the link above and place it on your Desktop

* Download and run Cydia Impactor for your operating system from [here](http://www.cydiaimpactor.com)

* Make sure no other WhatsApp with the same bundle identifier is installed. (net.whatsapp.WhatsApp if you chose original IPA or com.fouadraheb.watusi for the duplicate)

* Connect your iOS device and hit "Trust" if prompted so that your device appears in Cydia Impactor

* Drag the IPA file from your Desktop to Cydia Impactor

* Enter your Apple ID email address when prompted

* Enter your password when prompted

* If you get an alert like the following, press "OK"

* Wait for Cydia Impactor to finish and you will find the app installed on your device

### FAQ
* If you receive "Please sign in with app-specific password" error, that's beacuse you have 2-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID. You have to go into Apple's website https://appleid.apple.com, log in with your account and create an app-specific password to use as your Apple ID's password on Cydia Impactor.

### Note

* Signing with a non developer account will have the app expire in 7 days and you'll need to repeat the process again.
* The app will not receive Push Notifications and you won't be able to use iCloud features.
